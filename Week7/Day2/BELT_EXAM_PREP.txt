EXAM is emulating a take home challenge
The exam is written as a real life example of a potential employer giving you a timed exercise to test your knowledge

1. take 100% of the exam time! 
ORANGE BELT = 24 hours total
RED/BLACK BELT = 5hours 

DO NOT DROP EARLY - take breaks
👉 Ask Clarification questions

2. Don't panic!
- the only risk here is for you to find and expose a weakness to study and correct! 🙂

3. Don't watch the clock ⏳
- set alarms for mid way - last hour and last 20 mins

4. Start with what you know
- save black-belt features for the end

5. Don't start the exam until you have your environment setup and ready
- 📂 client - react client
- 📂 server - node server
(boiler plate) --> *

6. Use exam instructions as checklist and follow the yellow sticky notes
- double check before submitting***
- don't overthink features - do only what the exam asks

7. Use the platform - 100% of the RED BELT features are IN the platform. No Github or AI


8. If you have trouble submitting - 🗑️🚮delete/EXCLUDE node_modules BOTH OF THEM!
/client 
/server
npm install

9. Don't go over time, submit anyway I will still code review it.
- ALWAYS submit what you have
- not submitting is automatic FAIL

10. Even if you are feeling nervous - Take the exam anyway as an assignment and finish it

11. You don't have to submit a video*


12. Don't cheat. PERIOD
- it's very easy to catch cheaters
- code is like a fingerprint
- you need to feel comfortable about what you do and do not know to survive an engineering role
    AVAILABLE RESOURCES
    - Learn Platform
    - ONLY Our class Github + YOUR Git repo
    - Your code, your notes
    - Official documentation
    - Stack Overflow / Google

13. ASKING FOR HELP
 - this is an EXAM ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	-> what route is it not working on?
	-> what function is it in?
	-> what response is/not coming back?
 - if you are stuck on a bug for > 20 mins I may or may not POINT you to a direction


14. GETTING GRADED
 - double and triple check that you met ALL REQUIREMENTS. 
 - test all routes / features
 - design of the App
 - MUST SUBMIT before grading

 
15. After finishing an exam: 
-> take a break! you did it!
-> read PROJECT STACK
-> Friday Planning Meeting -> wireframes/user stories demo
